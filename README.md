# Solving problems from Project Euler in C#
Solutions to mathematical problems from [Project Euler ](https://projecteuler.net/problems) written in C#. Mostly just brute force to get to a solution.

Also a little app which scrapes the website to show the problems in a Windows Forms UI. Computes and times the solutions on the fly and sticks them in a grid, for quick feedback.
